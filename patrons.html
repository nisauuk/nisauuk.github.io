	            </div>
				<div id="right-column" style = "padding:50px">
	              <p align="justify">Ramesh Arora is passionate about people, culture and the hotel and tourism industry. A
seasoned hospitality entrepreneur with over four decades of global experience across the
industry, Ramesh is driven by purpose and results. Apart from having a savvy knack for
business, he has his fingers on the pulse of all that&#39;s new and next in the industry. From fine-
tuning operational strategies to devising systems, processes, and standards at the
institutional level – he just can&#39;t stop tinkering. Ramesh has been instrumental in creating a
new paradigm for hotel operations that integrates wellness into every aspect of operations
with the focus on mindful living, happiness, and sustainable tourism.</p>
				  <p align="justify">A globally knowledgeable hospitality professional, Ramesh is a certified hotel administrator
from AH&amp;MA, USA, as well as a fellow member of institute of Hospitality United Kingdom.
He has worked hard to build a network of relationships within the travel industry that spans
continents, cultures, and generations. His approach of having an attitude of gratitude has
been recognized for its unique approach to hospitality and for delivering innovative
solutions for travellers seeking authentic experiences around the world. Ramesh has been a
visionary in the hotel industry for decades, and he has been recognized for his contributions
to the hospitality industry and to society in general. His work has been honoured by
prestigious organisations such as PATA, which awarded him &quot;Hotelier of the Year&quot; at ITB
Berlin; Stardust, which presented him with the &quot;Lifetime Contribution to Hotels and
Tourism&quot; award; and India Travel Awards, which named him India’s Tourism Ambassador.
His work was also recognized by the House of Commons in London, which presented him
with a &quot;Happiness Ambassador&quot; Award. With experiences spanning diverse cultures from
Asia, Middle East, and Africa, to Europe and the UK, Ramesh has managed hotels from
conception to completion and is adept at every aspect of hotel operation. He has been
involved in every aspect of hotel operations, development, and management, with expertise
in marketing, finance and profitability. In addition to overseeing two luxury hotel brands in
London -The Montcalm London and Park Grand London Hotels, Ramesh is serving as the
Managing Director of the Montcalm Hotel Group in London since 2000. The Hotel group
owns 24 properties and is the largest privately owned hotel group in London.</p>
				  <p align="justify">Ramesh, who has a strong emphasis on the application of digital marketing and technology,
was quick to embrace the initial online booking trend while others hesitated. The group&#39;s
impressive growth can be attributed to its constant focus on maintaining the highest
RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) and enhancing its reputation as one of the most
respected hotels in London. It is no surprise that his laser-sharp focus, and go-getter
attitude have yielded the desired results. His personal interests shaped his business
philosophy, including philanthropy, wellbeing, mindfulness, meditation, time management,
supporting charities such as United Nations Women UK and Karma Foundation for children’s
education and women&#39;s empowerment. Furthermore, Ramesh&#39;s zeal for tourism is
undoubtedly a central factor in his life—which he practises daily. He curates daily reflections
at the crack of dawn to promote a positive mind and finds his passion in sharing these with his close network and humanity more generally. </p>
