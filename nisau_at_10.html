		<p align="justify">The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK) had conducted a survey of Indian students to assess the impact of the lockdown on the higher education sector and found that nearly half of Indian students with an admission offer to a UK university from September 2020 were unsure whether to accept.
		<br>However, 45 per cent had accepted their offers and intended to carry on with their education in the UK as planned and only 5 per cent chose to defer their offers to the next academic year.
		<br>The findings coincide with those of the UK''s Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), which found that amid an overall spike in university applications for the year, most applicants from India were planning to start a course from the autumn semester, which begins next month.</p>

		<p align="justify">The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK) said its "#AskNISAU" session over the weekend attracted a virtual audience of over 2,000 prospective students, with queries ranging from job prospects to the coronavirus lockdown impact on UK universities.
		<br>Students have increasingly been complaining about receiving misleading/biased information from educational agents, a sector that remains unregulated in India. Notably, NISAU had previously called on the Indian government to appropriately regulate this sector,” the group said in a statement.
		<br>“To address students’ ambiguities and apprehensions with credible information in an unbiased manner, NISAU organised the UK’s first-ever session where current students, recent graduates and domain experts responded to students’ queries live in a virtual #AskNISAU session broadcast live on Facebook and Instagram,” it said.</p>

		<p align="justify">The most common nationality of the overseas student involved in UK university start-ups is Chinese, but there is a growing focus on entrepreneurship from other nations, in particular from India. As the National Indian Students and Alumni Union notes “a new chapter in the U.K. – India ties” with Indian students and British Higher Education forming the key pillar of this bilateral relationship in “a partnership going from strength to strength.”</p>

		<p align="justify">NISAU’s research was done to show what the impact of Covid-19 has been on Indian students and how it might affect their decisions around coming to the UK to study. The survey was conducted in early June and received 313 responses from Indian students across 20 States and UTs in India.  Other key findings were that 80% of respondents said they would not accept their offer if learning for the entire next year moved online.</p>

		<p align="justify">"We recently surveyed prospective Indian students holding offers from British Universities for the September 2020 intake. The message is very clear Indian students wish to continue to come to the UK but certain requirements must be met," said Sanam Arora, chairperson of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK).
		<br>"Students want the British classroom experience and access to university infrastructure such as research labs. Eighty per cent of respondents said they would not accept their offer if learning for the entire next year moved online. However, this number reduces to around 55 per cent if there is an initial period of online learning followed by on-campus teaching, and crucially, if the fees are accordingly discounted," she added.</p>

		<p align="justify">Mohanish Borana, president of National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK – a student organisation which has been working in the UK since 2012 – said a large number of Indian students had become stranded in the UK due to the pandemic.
		<br>“Many are facing financial difficulties in managing their emergency expenses due to the subsequent loss of part-time jobs,” he explained.
		<br>NISAU has been communicating with thousands of students, and the organisation has helped many hundreds of students who said they could not afford food, he added.</p>

Sanam Arora, NISAU’s chairwoman, says: “A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they can’t pay their rent or buy food.” She says there is an atmosphere of panic: “The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide.”</p>

"These are testing times for all, and we understand just how difficult it is for students in particular to be away from their families right now, as most of our volunteers are going through the same," said a NISAU-UK spokesperson.
		<br>"There are a series of activities planned, ranging from Netflix parties to webinars to career development and sessions from stand-up comics. We have extended this initiative to all Indians, no matter where in the world you are – NISAU has got your back," the spokesperson said.</p>
